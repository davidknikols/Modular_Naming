STUNNER COPY THINKING


THE FORMULA IS TO ADD A WORD TO CO-EXIST WITH THE SECTION (ID) "stun" =  <sectiopn id="alpha_stun"></section>
I THINK OF ALPHA AS MEANING FIRST, SO I MAKE THE CONNECTION AS THE FIRST SECTION WITH STUNNER COPY ON THE WEBSITE
IF THE STUNNER COPY IS RELATED TO WORK THEN MAYBE <sectiopn id="work_stun"></section> SO WE ALWAYS START NATIVE AND 
ADAPT TO THE NEW SETTING PER PROJECT.

AS FAR AS THE COPY LINES IN THE STUNNER- THE CLASS NAME (line- xxxxxx) which are CYAN MAGENTA YELLOW BLACK, ARE PERFECT
SINCE THEY DONT CLAIM ANY ORDER AND CAN BE STACKED IN ANY ORDER, IF MORE THAN FOUR LINES ARE NEEDED THE BACK UP OF 
( RED GREEN BLUE ) SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO COVER ANY EXTRAORDINARY STUNNER COPY.

BY SELF NAMING THE ADD ON TO THE ID (stun) ...(line) CLASS CAN BE CLONED SETTINGS CHANGED AND TARGETED
...BECAUSE WE WOULD SCOPE THE PARENT THEN TRAVERSE DOWN INTO THE (LINE-) CLASS.....


<section id="stun">

<div class=" text-center text-uppercase line-cyan">
                FIRST LINE OF STUNNER COPY
            </div>

<div class=" text-center text-uppercase line-magenta">
                SECOND LINE OF STUNNER COPY
            </div>

<div class=" text-center text-uppercase line-yellow">
                THIRD LINE OF STUNNER COPY
            </div>            

<div class=" text-center text-uppercase line-black">
                THIRD LINE OF STUNNER COPY
            </div>  


</section>

THIS IS WHAT I GATHER SO FAR A LINE OF STUNNER CAN USE TO COMPLETELY DEFERENTIATE ITSELF, SO THIS CAN BE ORGANIZED AND CLONED
THROUGHOUT ITS REPURPOSE ON THE SITE, EVERY STUNNER ON THE PAGE CAN START OF WITH THIS MODULE AND THEN CUSTOMIZE IT
